# Project REST-Rant

REST-Rant is an app where users can review restaurants.

## User Stories ## 
"As a customer I'm looking to be able to provide honest **_feedback_, _see menu items_, _view reviews_, _view image pictures_** so that I can steer my peers in the right direction of where to eat and spend their money!" 

## Wireframes ## 
On paper - TBD 

## Color Scheme ## 
Going for a calming and sophisticated color palette with neutrals and maybe a pop of lavender or a light blue
